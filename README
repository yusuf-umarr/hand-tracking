#Hand Tracking

A Python project utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time.

Features:

- Hand detection and tracking using MediaPipe
- Finger landmark detection
- Real-time FPS display
- Adjustable detection and tracking confidence

Usage:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries: cv2 and mediapipe
3. Run the script using python (link unavailable)
4. The script will detect and track hands in real-time using your webcam

Classes and Functions:

- handDetector class: Initializes the hand detector with adjustable parameters
- findHands function: Detects hands in an image and draws landmarks
- findPosition function: Returns the list of finger landmarks

Notes:

- Adjust detection and tracking confidence by modifying the detectionCon and trackCon parameters in the handDetector class
- The project is in its early stages, and future updates will include improved performance and additional features
